# Auto-Copy

Automatically copy URLs to your clipboard when you open the Umbrella popup, providing a faster workflow.

## How It Works

When auto-copy is enabled (default):

1. Click the Umbrella extension icon
2. URLs are immediately copied to your clipboard
3. A success message appears in the popup
4. No additional clicks required

## Enabling/Disabling

To toggle auto-copy:

1. Open the Umbrella popup
2. Click **Options**
3. Find the "Auto-copy URLs on popup open" checkbox
4. Check to enable, uncheck to disable
5. Click **Save Settings**

## When to Use Auto-Copy

### Enable Auto-Copy When:
- You primarily use the extension to copy URLs
- You want the fastest possible workflow
- You rarely use the paste functionality
- You prefer keyboard shortcuts for more control

### Disable Auto-Copy When:
- You want to choose when URLs are copied
- You frequently use both copy and paste features
- You want to review your tabs before copying
- You prefer manual control over clipboard operations

## Alternative Workflows

If you disable auto-copy, you can still copy URLs using:

### Manual Copy Button
1. Open the popup
2. Click the "Copy URLs" button
3. URLs are copied to clipboard

### Keyboard Shortcut
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+U`
- **Mac**: `Cmd+Shift+U`

No popup interaction needed.

### Context Menu
1. Right-click anywhere on a webpage
2. Select "Copy URLs"
3. URLs are copied to clipboard

## Tips

- Combine with keyboard shortcuts for ultimate speed
- Use context menu when popup is inconvenient
- Disable auto-copy during paste-heavy workflows
- Auto-copy respects your default format preference
