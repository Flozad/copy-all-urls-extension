# Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions for Umbrella Chrome extension.

## Settings Not Saving

If your settings are being forgotten or reset to defaults:

### Quick Fix
1. Open the Umbrella popup
2. Click **Options**
3. Click **Check Storage Health**
4. If issues are detected, click **Repair Storage**
5. Reconfigure your settings

### Common Causes
- Chrome sync issues
- Storage quota exceeded
- Extension permissions changed
- Browser profile corruption

## Clipboard Not Working

If copying or pasting isn't working:

### Verify Permissions
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Umbrella - Copy All URLs"
3. Check that "Clipboard Read" and "Clipboard Write" are enabled
4. Reload the extension if permissions were just granted

### Browser Restrictions
- Some clipboard operations require HTTPS
- Chrome may block clipboard access on certain pages
- Try from a regular webpage (not chrome:// pages)

## Keyboard Shortcuts Not Working

If shortcuts aren't responding:

### Check Shortcut Configuration
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`
2. Verify shortcuts are set for Umbrella
3. Check for conflicts with other extensions
4. Try different key combinations

### Common Issues
- Shortcuts don't work on `chrome://` pages (Chrome restriction)
- Some key combinations are reserved by the OS
- Focus must be on a Chrome window
- Another extension may be using the same shortcut

## URLs Not Detected When Pasting

If pasted content doesn't open tabs:

### Supported Formats
Ensure your clipboard contains URLs in one of these formats:

- Plain text URLs (one per line)
- Markdown links: `[title](url)`
- HTML links: `<a href="url">title</a>`
- Quoted URLs: `"url"` or `'url'`

### Common Issues
- URLs must start with `http://` or `https://`
- Multiple formats mixed in clipboard may cause parsing issues
- Very large clipboard content may timeout

Badge indicators and their meanings:

- **✓** (checkmark): Operation successful
- **!** (exclamation): Warning or partial success
- **∅** (empty set): No URLs found to copy
- **⏳** (hourglass): Processing operation

### If Badge Shows Error
1. Check browser console for detailed error message
2. Verify you have open tabs to copy
3. Test clipboard access manually
4. Try reloading the extension

## Context Menu Not Appearing

If right-click menu items are missing:

1. Check "Show context menu items" in Options is enabled
2. Refresh the webpage after enabling
